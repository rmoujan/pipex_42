As a responsible and accomplished developer, when you encounter
a bug in your application, what’s the first thing you do? Write
a failing test case, of course, and only once that’s done do you focus
on fixing the problem. But what about when the bug is not related to the behavior of your
application, but rather to its configuration, display, or some other element outside 
the purview of normal testing practices? 
I contend that you can and should still write a failing test.
